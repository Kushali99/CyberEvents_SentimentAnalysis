# Cybersecurity Media Sentiment Analysis

## Overview  
This repository contains an academic data analytics project that examines how global news media sentiment changes before, during, and after high-profile cybersecurity incidents. The project extends traditional cybersecurity research by focusing on the societal and communicative impact of cyber events, analysing how media framing influences public perception, organisational reputation, and regulatory response.

The study uses GDELT 2.0, a large-scale global news database, to perform longitudinal and geographic sentiment analysis of cybersecurity-related media coverage.

## Research Objectives  
The project aims to:
- Build a longitudinal time-series dataset of media tone related to cybersecurity incidents.
- Analyse sentiment trends before and after major cyber incidents.
- Compare sentiment patterns across different countries and regions.
- Assess the impact of media sentiment on public trust, organisational reputation, and policy attention.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for cyber incident communication strategies.

## Data Source  
- GDELT 2.0 (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)  
  - Multilingual, near real-time global news coverage  
  - Includes event metadata, locations, actors, and sentiment indicators such as average tone

## Methodology  
1. Extraction of cybersecurity-related news events from GDELT 2.0  
2. Construction of time-series datasets using sentiment metrics  
3. Pre- and post-incident sentiment analysis  
4. Geographic comparison across countries and regions  
5. Interpretation of sentiment trends against known cyber incident timelines  

## Tools and Technologies  
- R and Python for data extraction and analysis  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment evaluation  
- Time-series and statistical analysis methods  
- Data visualisation libraries for trend analysis  

## Scope and Limitations  
- Analysis is limited to news media coverage and excludes social media and internal organisational communications.  
- GDELT coverage may vary by region, language, and media outlet.  
- Automated sentiment analysis may not fully capture contextual, cultural, or domain-specific nuances.  
- Temporal granularity is constrained by data availability (daily or weekly).

## Expected Outcomes  
- Visualisations showing sentiment shifts around cybersecurity incidents  
- Comparative insights into regional media responses  
- Practical recommendations for organisational cyber crisis communication  

## Academic Context  
This project is part of an academic study in cybersecurity and data analytics. It contributes to existing literature by integrating media sentiment analysis with cybersecurity incident research, offering both theoretical and practical insights.
